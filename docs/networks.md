# Beacon Networks

Many Beacon instances will be part of networks, although a Beacon can be instantiated as stand-alone solution.
The Beacon design includes several features aimed to be consumed by Beacon network aggregators. For example,
a Beacon endpoint declares which entities are implemented in that particular instance, which are the ontology
terms supported or the URL endpoints where different elements could be found.

With the finalization of the Beacon v2 protocol we will son provide information about
Beacon v2 network implementations.
