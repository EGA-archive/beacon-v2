## Registry Server

The Beacon registry server, hosted through the European Genome-Phenome Archive, monitors
a number of implementations of the Beacon v2 protocol by various organisations actively involved
in Beacon protocol development.

## Example Implementations

### Progenetix API

The Progenetix database and cancer genomic information resource contains genome profiles
of more than 140?~@~Y000 individual cancer genome screening experiments, with the majority
representing results from genomic copy number assessment studies. With its
Beacon<span style="color: red; font-weight: 800;"><sup>+</sup></span> forward-looking test
implementation, since 2016 Progenetix has been developing concepts for Beacon protocol extensions
such as CNV query options or handover data delivery.
