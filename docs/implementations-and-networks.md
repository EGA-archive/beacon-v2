## Example Implementations

### Progenetix API

The Progenetix database and cancer genomic information resource contains genome profiles
of more than 140â€™000 individual cancer genome screening experiments, with the majority
representing results from genomic copy number assessment studies. With its

implementation, since 2016 Progenetix has been developing concepts for Beacon protocol extensions
such as CNV query options or handover data delivery.
