# Welcome to the Beacon v2 Documentation

!!! Note "Approved GA4GH Standard"

        On [2022-04-22](formats-standards/#dates-and-times) Beacon v2 has been approved as an official [GA4GH standard](https://www.ga4gh.org/).

With growing interest from the community in the implementation of the Beacon protocol into resources and workflows, the major 2.0 release scheduled for Spring 2022 will introduce [new features](what-is-beacon-v2.md) which were considered important by the community.
