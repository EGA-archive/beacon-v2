# Welcome to the Beacon v2 Documentation

!!! Warning "Under Development"

        Note that Beacon v2 is still [under development](https://github.com/ga4gh-beacon/beacon-v2-Models) and needs to be approved by the [GA4GH](https://www.ga4gh.org/).

With growing interest from the community in the implementation of the Beacon protocol into resources and workflows, the major 2.0 release scheduled for Spring 2022 will introduce [new features](what-is-beacon-v2.md) which were considered important by the community.
