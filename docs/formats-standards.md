# Formats, Standards and Integrations

## Data Formats and Standards

### Coding and naming conventions

For historical reasons, in the names of entities, parameters and URLs we are following these conventions:

* Entity names: `PascalCase` 
* parameters: `camelCase` 
* URI path elements: `snake_case` 

The only exception is: `service-info` which is a required GA4GH standard and has a different word separation convention.

### Schema Language and Conventions

==JSON Schema, YAML/JSON, camelCasing and others ...==

### Genome Coordinates

==0-based interbase etc., see schemablocks.org==

### Dates and Times

==ISO8601 etc., see schemablocks.org==

## Integration with External Standards

The development of the Beacon v2 framework and default model closely follows
and widely adopts concepts and schemas from approved GA4GH products such as
Phenopackets and the Variant Representation Standard (VRS).
