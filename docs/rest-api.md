### Progenetix API

The Progenetix database and cancer genomic information resource contains genome profiles
of more than 140â€™000 individual cancer genome screening experiments, with the majority
representing results from genomic copy number assessment studies. With its Beacon<span style="color: red; font-weight: 800;"><sup>+</sup></span> forward-looking test implementation, since 2016 Progenetix has been developing
concepts for Beacon protocol extensions such as CNV query options or handover data delivery.
